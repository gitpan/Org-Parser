* todo
** parser
*** TODO add line number information
perhaps _linenum_start and _linenum_end attributes to signify the starting and
ending line numbers of current element. so the parser can report:

: syntax error in table (lines XX-YY): invalid line in table 'blah'

and then instead of:

: die "syntax error in table ..."

the elements do something like this instead to report error:

: $doc->_croak("invalid line in table");

and the document will provide the additional line number and element
information.

*** TODO parse horizontal rules
from the manual: "A line consisting of only dashes, and at least 5 of them, will
be exported as a horizzontal line (‘<hr/>’ in HTML and \hrule in LaTeX)."

** Element::Base
*** TODO set_property()
- should create a properties drawer if necessary
** table
*** TODO caption(), label(), etc
Get it from settings:

: #+CAPTION: A long table
: #+LABEL: tbl:long
: |...|...|
: |...|...|

note: the setting can be interspersed with other lines/elements, they will be
apply to the next thing (table) that wants it, e.g.:

: #+CAPTION: A long table
: some text
: #+LABEL: tbl:long
: some more text
: |...|...|
: |...|...|

*** TODO column group (manual: 3.3)
probably create Element::TableColGroup which is a special row that contains
column group instruction. or we can just assume it's a normal row and only
format() needs to worry about this (i prefer the latter).
** footnote
** link
** target
** radio target
** timestamp & time range
*** what's the difference between SCHEDULED and DEADLINE timestamp?
*** TODO parse sexp entries?
e.g.

: ** Class 7:00pm-9:00pm
:    <%%(and (= 1 (calendar-day-of-week date)) (diary-block 2 16 2009 4 20 2009))>

: * Monthly meeting
:  <%%(diary-float t 3 3)>

** plain lists (ordered, unordered, description)
** headline
*** TODO Parse headline percentages
*** TODO next_todo_state() & prev_todo_state()
return undef if .document is undef.
*** TODO cycle_todo_state($reverse // 0)
*** TODO promoto_subtree() & demote_subtree()
** drawer & properties
*** TODO check valid values of property (foo_ALL)
*** TODO fix parsing of property values
need clarification first

: :PROPERTY:
:   :birthday:  (5 7 1990)
: :END:

** setting
*** TODO [low] differentiate between TYP_TODO and TODO/SEQ_TODO
"TODO and SEQ_TODO are the same. TYP_TODO is slightly different in operation.
When you press C-c C-t in a line with the keyword defined by TYP_TODO, the task
will immediately switch to DONE, instead of to the next state in the sequence. I
do believe the manual explains this quite well, but I don't believe many people
use this." -- carsten

this is probably useful if we already have next_todo_state() et al. We'll need
to note which todo keywords belong to TYP_TODO.
*** TODO process includes (#+INCLUDE)

*** TODO parse buffer-wide header arguments (#+BABEL, 14.8.1)
*** TODO parse link abbreviation (#+LINK)
into document's .link_abbrevs()
*** TODO check tags in document against TAGS
"TAGS defines tags that will be used in the buffer and defines fast keyboard
shortcuts for them. Though you are allowed to also use tags that are not in tis
list." -- carsten

we can introduce a strict mode, for example, where all tags must belong to the
list specified in TAGS.
*** TODO TAGS/FILETAGS: parse keyboard shortcuts
 #+TAGS: OFFICE(o) COMPUTER(c) HOME(h) PROJECT(p) READING(r) DVD(d)
the key should be discarded when checking for known tags

** block
*** TODO parse dynamic blocks
see org-mode manual on dynamic blocks.

basically it's just blocks with a slightly different syntax and :param value as
args:

: #BEGIN: dynblockname :param1 value1 :param2 value2
: #END:

** macro
*** TODO parse macro
manual section 11.6 Macro replacement

although the parser can also choose to ignore this and let the export handle the
parsing.
